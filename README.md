The Minimum Spanning Tree of Maximum Entropy (2015) : https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06319

Minimum spanning tree is built by Weighted Union-Find algorithm with Path Compression & Fibonacci Heap.
Final MST result can be regularized by entropy_lambda hyperparameter which is the ratio between the Maximization of Entropy or Minimization of distance of final MST edges.
